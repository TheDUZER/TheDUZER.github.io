        <p>My name is Ian Guitard, in case that wasn't obvious already. Yes, I do play SOME guitar, but I much prefer percussion.
      I'm an IT professional with decades of experience between the workplace and my hobbies.</p>
      <p>Professionally, I've built web-based services, 
      designed and architected computer networks, managed multi-million dollar IT projects, informed corporate decisions with data visualizations and in-depth analysis via business intelligence and 
      machine learning processes, and (most importantly) provided courteous and patient communication with clients, customers and colleagues. That last bit 
      really shouldn't need to be said, but some of the things I've seen in the workplace tell me it's a valuable enough skill to mention. I'm a proud personality hire in that sense.</p>
      <p>In my spare time, I try to join my interests with my professional skills as much as possible. I spend far more time than I should building hierarchies for my hoard of files and data to keep things
       organized, and far less time than I would like collecting that data and putting it to interesting use. I frequently find myself on new web scraping tangents to collect info for a tabletop game that has piqued 
      my interest, digging through HTML tables and pulling from public APIs to compile data and repurpose it. I've reverse engineered online strategy games in some cases, and in most others I've generated templates for
       physical materials to be used on the table. I have folders that need to be sorted that are just littered with scripts, JSON files, serialized object models, all kinds of things that were used to make cards, game pieces,
       reference sheets, randomizers, search tools, the list goes on.</p>
      <p>Beyond my professional career and obsessive tendencies, I'm a proud father of 5 with my wonderful wife (who deserves the world, I mean, 5 kids!) We scrounge up what little spare time we can to play games, go to the drive-in theater, 
      frequent the parks and attractions of Central Florida, and... relax. Which is not so easy, unfortunately. But we try. It's much easier now that we've both completed our Master's degrees with Florida State University, but there's little to no rest for the weary.</p>
